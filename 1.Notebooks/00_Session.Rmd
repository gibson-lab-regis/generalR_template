Be sure that your knit directory is set to project directory. (Arrow by preview -\> Knit Directory -\> Project directory)

This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code.

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

Execute a chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.

Notes:
-  you don't need to download the data. This has already been done in this template repository in which you're working
-  under "Customizing R," the settings/preferences is now under "Tools" -> Global Options, instead of by clicking RStudio
-  For the "R Scripts" section, you can either practice making a script or just run the code in a chunk below

```{r}

```
