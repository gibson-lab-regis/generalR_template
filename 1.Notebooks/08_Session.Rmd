Be sure that your knit directory is set to project directory. (Arrow by preview -> Knit Directory -> Project directory)

This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Execute a chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.

**Instructions**

[08 instructions](https://riffomonas.org/generalR/08_session.html)

```{r}
library(tidyverse)

aa_weather <- read_csv('noaa/USC00200230.csv', col_types="ccDdddddddddd") %>%
	select(DATE, starts_with("T"), PRCP, SNOW, SNWD) %>%
	rename("date" = "DATE",
		"t_max_c" = "TMAX",
		"t_min_c" = "TMIN",
		"t_obs_c" = "TOBS",
		"total_precip_mm" = "PRCP",
		"snow_fall_mm" = "SNOW",
		"snow_depth_mm" = "SNWD") %>%
	mutate(t_obs_c = ifelse(t_obs_c > 40 | t_obs_c < -40, NA, t_obs_c),
		total_precip_mm = ifelse(total_precip_mm > 250, NA, total_precip_mm),
		snow_fall_mm = ifelse(snow_fall_mm > 500, NA, snow_fall_mm),
		snow_depth_mm = ifelse(snow_depth_mm > 500, NA, snow_depth_mm)
